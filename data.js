It means “praise” in Latin. During the prayer, they sing polyphonic hymns and read psalms. Around 20 people attended Saturday morning to pray with the nuns and monks.</p><h2>The Fraternity of Jerusalem. <span class='title-sub-text'>“In the heart of the city, in the heart of God”</span></h2><p>The monastic fraternities of Jerusalem were founded in 1975 by Brother Pierre-Marie Delfieux. After spending two years in the Sahara Desert, he created a community that aimed to live in the heart of cities, while maintaining the spirit of the monastic desert. Its main principles are love, prayer, work, silence, and hospitality to guide their lives. Chastity, poverty, obedience, and humility are the fundamentals values of their monastic life. The monks and nuns live in fraternity and have a strict rhythm of life but can work part-time and are in contact with secular people. The Catholic community is present in six different countries in Europe and North America.</p>"

Then, you spend one year in “postulate” where you live in the community. After, you take the suit and enter a two-year long “noviciate”, a kind of intense training. At that point, you take your temporary profession - your first vows for three years, renewable one time.

There, she met a Russian iconographer, and in 2006, she finally started to learn something she always wanted to learn: to paint icons. Iconographers are a story of masters and disciples.

You have to live in community to do that. I have done other things before, I have a pension, but it takes many hours and you can’t ask people to give you more than they can: for me it’s an evangelization by the icon. There is the prayer of the iconographer, which is very beautiful, that I say it before starting to work, it is a very ancient prayer:<br><br>'You divine master of all that exists, direct the heart, soul and mind of your servant, guide her hands, so that she can represent with dignity and perfectly your image, that of your holy mother, that of the angels and of all the saints, for the glory, the joy and the embellishment of your holy church.'

In the chapel of the house, she took time of her afternoon to read and comment on the “Book of Life”, their spiritual path, with Quitterie, seated to the right.<br><br>“What I like most about community life with the sisters, is being able to meet them, to greet Jesus in them, the face of Christ, that's what I like. I knew this liturgy 43 years ago. And then now I feel like I'm starting all over again, I'm starting from scratch, as if it was the beginning. I am like a little child again, so I live in the present moment, and I learn to walk again.”</p><h2>A familiar of the Fraternity</h2><p>Quitterie is not a nun, but what we call a “familiar”, a consecrated secular. She decided to take a spiritual commitment with the Fraternity and must renew her profession each year. The difference is that she has a foot in a secular life, she lives in Rouen, has her flat, her job… But she follows the principles of the Fraternity, wears the same cross as the nuns, has her room at the house and comes often in retreat, every month or so.</p>"

You see with Covid-19, all these distresses... I say to myself; I also participate in this great fight. So, I am not a doctor...
